Its clear that there is a hidden admin form and we can access that by pasting this in the console.

document.getElementById('adminFormHash').value = "2196812e91c29df34f5e217cfd639881";
document.getElementById('hiddenAdminForm').submit();


If you can't paste it in the console, first enter allow pasting and then paste the above code.
