my initial guess is to change something in request headers. And the hints given suggest the same.
lets try changing the request header. when the header is GET, red is the background, for post - it is Blue, other than that it is white.

The answer is in the name of the challenge - "get aHEAD". Change the header of the request to HEAD to get the flag.
